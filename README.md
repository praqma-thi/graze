# Graze

This repository contains nothing of value (for now)

## Future description

Graze is a simple programming game where you can contribute a Cow and see how it fares in the pastures.

Cows are set loose on a grid with some grass.
They can move around, eat, or poop.
Eventually, cows will go hungry and ~~die~~ return to their home planet.
Last (kind of) cow standing wins.

## Rules

A work in progress.
